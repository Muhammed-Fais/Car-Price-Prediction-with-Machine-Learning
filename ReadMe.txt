Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are:

•	Brand
•	Model
•	Horsepower
•	Mileage
•	Safety Features
•	GPS and many more.
If one ignores the brand of the car, a car manufacturer primarily fixes the price of a car based on the features it can offer a customer. Later, the brand may raise the price depending on its goodwill, but the most important factors are what features a car gives you to add value to your life. So, in the section below, I will walk you through the task of training a car price prediction model with machine learning using the Python programming language.

Car Price Prediction Model using Python
1.	The dataset I’m using here to train a car price prediction model was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains data about all the main features that contribute to the price of a car. So let’s start this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:
 


2.	There are 26 columns in this dataset, so it is very important to check whether or not this dataset contains null values before going any further:

3.	So this dataset doesn’t have any null values, now let’s look at some of the other important insights to get an idea of what kind of data we’re dealing with:

4.	The price column in this dataset is supposed to be the column whose values we need to predict. So let’s see the distribution of the values of the price column:
 






5.	Now let’s have a look at the correlation among all the features of this dataset:
 

6.	Training a Car Price Prediction Model
7.	I will use the decision tree regression algorithm to train a car price prediction model. So let’s split the data into training and test sets and use the decision tree regression algorithm to train the model:

    The model gives 100% accuracy on the test set, which is excellent.
 

Summary
So this is how you can train a machine learning model for the task of predicting car prices by using the Python programming language. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. I hope you liked this project of training a model for predicting car prices with machine learning.
