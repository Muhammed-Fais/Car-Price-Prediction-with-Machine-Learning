# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

The prediction of car prices is one of the key topics of machine learning research. Its foundations are in the fields of finance and marketing. The price of an automobile relies on a variety of parameters, making it a significant research topic in machine learning. Several elements that significantly affect the cost of a car include:

* Brand
* Model
* Horsepower
* Mileage
* Safety Features
* GPS and many more.

If the car's brand is disregarded, a manufacturer will often set a car's price based on the characteristics it can provide a buyer. Later, the brand may increase the price based on its reputation, but the characteristics a car has are what matters most.

## Primary objective:
Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the sale price of used cars, using
data on car characteristics and historical sale prices.
## Solution:

* Analyzed and preprocessed the data using Python, including handling missing values
    and performing feature engineering.
* Trained and evaluated the model using various algorithms and techniques, such as
    random forests, gradient boosting, and cross-validation.
* Visualized and interpreted model results using data visualization tools such as
    Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* The model gives 100% accuracy on the test set.
